Dumping ground for learning SNOBOL

## Introduction

[SNOBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNOBOL) (StriNg Oriented and symBOlic Language) is an old, and largely forgotten programming language designed for manipulating strings.  

To run SNOBOL, download the compiler from [Viktors Berstis' website](http://berstis.com/s4ref/snobol4.htm) and then install (DOSBOX)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/dosbox/files/latest/download].  

From DOSBOX you will first need to mount the folder containing your SNOBOL code:

```
mount c C:\Users\jdorr\Desktop\Snobol
```

To run you code simply use:
```
SNOBOL4 00_HELLO.SNO /Q
```
